## 🔴 CRITICAL: DO THESE 5 THINGS TODAY

### 1. Submit Sitemap to Google (15 minutes)
1. Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Add property: `towpoint.in`
3. Verify ownership
4. Go to **Sitemaps** section
5. Enter: `https://towpoint.in/sitemap.xml`
6. Click **Submit**

**Why?** Google can't index what it doesn't know about.

---

### 2. Create Google Business Profile (60 minutes)
**THIS IS THE #1 PRIORITY FOR LOCAL SEO**

1. Go to https://business.google.com
2. Create profile for "TOWPOINT"
3. Add all service areas (Gujarat cities)
4. Upload 10-20 photos
5. Add services and pricing
6. Submit for verification

**Result:** Appear in Google Maps + Local Pack = 80% of calls!

📖 **Full Guide:** See `GOOGLE_BUSINESS_PROFILE_SETUP.md`

---

### 3. Set Up Google Analytics (20 minutes)
1. Go to https://analytics.google.com
2. Create new property for towpoint.in
3. Copy measurement ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
4. Add tracking code to `index.html` (before `</head>` tag):

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

**Why?** Track visitors, conversions, and optimize based on data.

---

### 4. Verify HTTPS is Enabled (5 minutes)
1. Check with Hostinger if SSL certificate is active
2. Test: Visit https://towpoint.in (should show padlock 🔒)
3. If not enabled, enable in Hostinger dashboard (usually free)
4. Force HTTPS redirect in hosting settings

**Why?** Google penalizes non-HTTPS sites in rankings.

---

### 5. Request First 10 Reviews (30 minutes)
1. Make list of 10 recent customers
2. Send WhatsApp/SMS with Google review link
3. Politely ask for honest review
